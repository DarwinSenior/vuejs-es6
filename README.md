# vuejs-es6: A Todo App
A special thanks to [vuejs-templates/webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack). I used this project as one of my references and go-tos for inspiration as I developed this project.

## Getting Started
You will need to have MongoDB installed to use the API and save items.
* Run `npm install` to install all NodeJS dependencies
* Run `bower install` to download bower dependencies
* `npm run dev` fires up the Webpack dev server
