# nodejs-es6: A seed project
This project is my Webpack playground. It also makes use of Babel for ES6 scripting and Stylus for pre-processing CSS.

## Getting Started
You will need to have Webpack and Bower installed globally. Then, run `npm install` and `bower install` to install all dependencies.
* `npm run dev` fires up the Webpack dev server
* `npm run build` outputs `bundle.js` in the `build` directory.
